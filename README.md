# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I think this project could have integrated more use of the transition and transform elements. It would provide and extra layer to grab the conusumer's attention. We utilize the pulse animation in the about section. I'd like to see that earlier on in the project as well.
